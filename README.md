# AudibleClone

> A clone of Audible onboarding screens on mobile

This project is mainly for learning and setup for others to contribute to in order to learn swift.

It's also going to be putting architecture as part of the learning experience. 
I intend to make use of the MVP (Model View Presenter) design pattern.

It's a great way to learn and also celebrate hacktoberfest 2020.

I hope this helps someone
